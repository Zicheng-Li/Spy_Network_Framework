# Spy_Network_Framework

I have designed a spy network using several design patterns, including the Observer pattern, Strategy pattern, Singleton pattern, and Decorator pattern. The purpose of this network is to propagate encryption schemes so that spies can communicate securely with each other. This network makes use of the observer pattern to propagate the encryption schemes, the strategy pattern for the selection of the encryption algorithm, the singleton pattern for the creation of the encryption schemes and the decorator pattern for the encryption and decryption of the messages sent between the spies. 

The idea is to allow spies to communicate with other spies in the network in an encrypted manner. There are three entities in the network: a home base, field bases, and spies. There may be multiple field bases and spies, but there is only one home base. Field bases are registered with the home base, and spies are registered with a single field base. Field bases are allowed to unregister from the home base. They can choose to re-register with the home base at any point in the future. If a spy died, then a signal is sent to the field base to unregister them. All entities share an encryption scheme and a key. All entities can send messages and receive messages from each other.
